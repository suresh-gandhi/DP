/*
    Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score of n,
    we need to find the number of ways to reach a given score.

    Lets say that we are given a score of 30. I try to think of the last step here. What could have I done
    to reach here. Either I could have scored 3 at the last or 5 or 10 and made it to 30. All of these are
    different possible paths to reach 30 as the last step is different in all of the three. Also, we can say
    that these are the only possible paths to reach 30. We can't do something else! We have to go through these.
    Hence I can say that if try to find all the possible different paths to reach 27(30 - 3) and all the possible
    different paths to reach 25(30 - 5) and all the possible different paths to reach 20(30 - 10). Then I can say
    that total of these would give me the required answer. Let us denote T(n) to be the total number of ways
    to reach a given score of n. Then based upon our logic we can say that
        T(n) = T(n - 3) + T(n - 5) + T(n - 10)
    Doing this we could eventually boil down to T(0) which is nothing but the number of ways to reach 0 from itself.
    No need to reach there we are already here and it is 1. We can't reach negative numbers clearly and it should return
    0.
    Ofcourse I am assuming that the order in which the scores are written makes sense that is
    3, 5 to make 8 is different from 5, 3 to make 8. They are not the same. Their last step is
    different and would be counted as different ways according to our algorithm.
